# 24 Hour Support Wiki

[Return to main wiki page](https://github.com/CommandMC/24HS-Wiki/blob/main/index.md)

## What am I providing?

The file you will provide contains no personal information about you. It will provide the local IP address (which is not something anyone can use against you), driver version information of devices, name of USB devices and hardware connected, and name of user account logged in. As long as you don't do something like naming your user account as your house address or full name, nothing personal is included here.

### Option 1: The automated way

1. Download the [24HS-Automator](https://github.com/CommandMC/24HS-Automator/releases/latest) and run it.
2. Click the 2nd button ("MSInfo32 Report (Sysinfo)") and answer the questions there. If you don't know the answer to a question, you can leave it blank.
3. Either press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>V</kbd> **in the channel you were asked for the file** or manually attach the file (it's on your Desktop and will be named "DanielIsCool.txt") using the âŠ• button to the left of the message input box

### Option 2: The manual way

<details>
  <summary>Expand me</summary>

## How to provide useful information about your system

1. Did you do any overclocks anywhere (other than enabling XMP in bios)?
2. When you got this computer, which of these methods did you do to get Windows up and running?
    <ol type=a>
        <li>I just bought the computer and it came with Windows already.</li>
        <li>I created a Windows USB, booted into it with no drives connected (with the exception of the USB and the drive I wanted to install Windows on), deleted all partitions if there were any and installed in the unallocated space.</li>
        <li>I took an already made Windows USB or CD (like if you bought one from a shop), booted into it with no drives connected (with the exception of the USB and the drive I wanted to install Windows on), deleted all partitions if there were any and installed in the unallocated space.</li>
        <li>I did either b or c, but did not remove all drives before doing so (with the exception of the USB and the drive I wanted to install Windows on), or simply did upgrade or installed in a partition without deleting it.</li>
        <li>I cloned / transferred a Windows install from another computer.</li>
    </ol>
3. Did you modify Windows? Please answer if you followed any debloat guide, anti spy scripts or applications, disabled Windows updates, pirated Windows, or ANY MODIFICATION. PLEASE DISCLOSE THIS. This includes you BLOCKING Microsoft domains from connecting to your computer (regardless if this is outside, like with a pihole or a VPN or whatever, this counts as modifying the behavior of Windows)

 The following questions **only** need to be answered if you have a desktop. **You do not have to answer these questions if you're on a laptop.**

 ---
4. What power supply model do you have? [See how to find this out](https://www.xtremegaminerd.com/two-easy-ways-to-know-what-power-supply-you-have/). DO NOT JUST TELL US THE WATTAGE. WE WANT EXACT MODEL. Telling us only the manufacturer or wattage is not helpful! We want **THE EXACT MODEL**
5. Are you using PCIe Riser cables or are you connecting your GPU (and any PCI card) directly to the motherboard?
6. Are you using the power supply cables that came with your power supply or third party ones? Are you using any extensions? Are you using any adapters?
7. If you have a GPU that requires multiple power connectors, [are you connecting them using individual power connectors coming from the PSU, or using a single cable that splits into two or more](https://i.imgur.com/MjToCN7.jpeg)?
8. What DIMM slots are your sticks in and how many sticks do you have? [For reference, A1 is the DIMM slot closest to your CPU, then A2, B1, and B2 being the furthest away from your CPU](https://i.imgur.com/zJWr8pc.png). Also what is your kit rated at? Are all the sticks from the same kit? (**Just because you bought the same model of RAM does not mean it's from the same kit. If all the sticks did not come in the same sealed box, they are not from the same kit!**)
9. Where are you connecting your monitor(s)? To your motherboard or to your graphics card? [See this photo if you are not sure what this means](https://i.imgur.com/z4dHNGU.jpg)
