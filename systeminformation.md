# 24 Hour Support Wiki


## What am I providing?

The file you will provide contains no personal information about you. It will provide the local IP address (which is not something anyone can use against you), driver version information of devices, name of USB devices and hardware connected, and name of user account logged in. As long as you don't do something like naming your user account as your house address or full name, nothing personal is included here.

## But is this a virus?

This is an Automator made to make this as simple and easy as possible for you. It is [completely open source](https://github.com/24HourSupport/Automator) which means you can audit it yourself to make sure it is not malicious. You can also of course scan it with your antivirus of choice.


# What do I do?

1. Visit the [24HS-Automator](https://github.com/CommandMC/24HS-Automator/releases/latest) page. (You click the text in blue in this line, it's a hyperlink)
2. Under "Assets" you click the one that says "24HS-Automator.exe", you download this then run it.
3. Click the 2nd button ("MSInfo32 Report (Sysinfo)") and answer the questions there. If you don't know the answer to a question, you can leave it blank.
4. Send the file **in the channel you were asked for it** by attaching the file (it's on your Desktop and will be named "DanielIsCool.txt") using the <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44484725/138221745-992ccdde-957a-4de6-acbb-61c324b89583.png" height=30px /> button to the left of the message input box
