## What am I providing?

The file you will provide contains no personal information about you. It will provide the local IP address (which is not something anyone can use against you), driver version information of devices, name of USB devices and hardware connected, and name of user account logged in. As long as you don't do something like naming your user account as your house address or full name, nothing personal is included here.

## But is this a virus?

This is an Automator made to make this as simple and easy as possible for you. It is [completely open source](https://github.com/24HourSupport/Automator) which means you can audit it yourself to make sure it is not malicious. You can also of course scan it with your antivirus of choice.

## When running it I get a 'Windows protected your PC, Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented and unrecognized app' warning.

This is nothing to be concerned about. If Windows Defender actually detected a virus then it wouldn't even show this, but instead block the download. This warning happens when an app developer refuses to pay Microsoft's [$600 a year license to make the warning go away. (You do not have to click this link to fix it)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/dashboard/get-a-code-signing-certificate)

All you have to do is click 'More info', then 'Run anyway'. If you have doubts that this is a virus, then go ahead and scan it with your anti-virus of choice.

2. Once the Automator is downloaded from the above link, open it. 
3. Click the 2nd button ("MSInfo32 Report (Sysinfo)") and answer the questions there. If you don't know the answer to a question, you can leave it blank.
4. Send the file **in the channel you were asked for it** by attaching the file (it's either on your Desktop or your Downloads and will be named "Sysinfo.txt") using the <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44484725/138221745-992ccdde-957a-4de6-acbb-61c324b89583.png" height=30px /> button to the left of the message input box
