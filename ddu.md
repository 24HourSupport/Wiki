### Changing GPUs
If you are changing GPUs (and aren't already on the new GPU), follow [this Wiki](https://github.com/CommandMC/24HS-Wiki/blob/main/changinggpus.md)

### Why should I do DDU?
DDU clean installs GPU drivers to eliminate the possibility of any driver or software conflicts. It is not a long process, and can quickly eliminate potential issues you may be having with your GPU.

Attempting to do this with the “clean install” option in the NVIDIA installer is not the same, as it does not thoroughly delete the GPU drivers and all NVIDIA software as DDU does. The current effect after you use this driver removal tool will be similar as if its the first time you install a new driver just like a fresh, clean install of Windows. 

### What is DDU?
Display Driver Uninstaller is a driver removal utility that can help you completely uninstall AMD/NVIDIA/Intel graphics card drivers and packages from your system, trying to remove all leftovers (including registry keys, folders and files, driver store).

The AMD/Nvidia/Intel video drivers can normally be uninstalled from the Windows Control panel or select the "clean install" option during installation, this driver uninstaller program was designed to be used when you need to thoroughly delete video card drivers and their related software.

The current effect after you use this driver removal tool will be similar as if its the first time you install a new driver just like a fresh, clean install of Windows.

The built in "clean install" functionality of the driver is NOT an alternative to DDU. **DDU removes EVERYTHING related to the driver**, and allows you to do a clean install properly. This will remove ANYTHING related to the driver (like GeForce Experience, AMD ReLive, etc)
